    My name is Abrahim Kenneh. I am currently a sophomore pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Management and Technology at Syracuse University. Although im not sure what i want to do with my degree yet, I know that I want to help protect and grow companies through the utilization of technology. I plan to minor in Finance to learn more about the field and to see how I can leverage my technical abilities with my finance background for optimal growth and performance. I am a student not only in the classroom, but also a student on the field as an outside linebacker for Syracuse. In my free time, I enjoy making homemade Mandingo food with my mother and staying in shape. I love to watch Netflix, especially Blacklist.
